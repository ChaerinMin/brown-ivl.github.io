## Overview

You can add text and links as normal in Markdown. For example, [this](isalink.com). _This_ text is italicized and **this** text is bolded.

Below are ways to add different types of media:

### Image

{% include full_image.html path="/assets/images/projects/[project name]/[image name/path]" alt="[Alt Text]" %}

### YouTube Video

<div class="center">
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="[link here]" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

### Video File

{% include video.html path="/assets/images/projects/[project name]/[video name/path]" %}

### Notes on Media Content

Please make sure to add all of your resource files needed for the website to the folder at the following path: [assets/images/projects/[project name]](/assets/images/projects/)

You can also add content via HTML for additional customization if desired. If you have other formats for content you would like to display, please feel free to contact me (Iris Huang) on Slack!
