      The Interactive 3D Vision & Learning Lab (IVL) led by <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/people/ssrinath/">Srinath Sridhar</a>, part of <a href="https://visual.cs.brown.edu/">Brown Visual Computing</a>, works on 3D computer vision and machine learning problems to better understand how humans interact with the world. Our research spans 3D spatiotemporal visual understanding of objects, humans in motion, and human-object interactions. Please see the <a href="https://ivl.cs.brown.edu/#/research"> research tab</a> for details on our research.

- **_Oct-2021_** I helped co-organize the [Second 3DReps workshop](https://ivl.cs.brown.edu/3DReps/) at ICCV. The workshop recording is now available at this [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VKTE1Svl30).

- **_Oct-2021_** [HuMoR](https://geometry.stanford.edu/projects/humor/), a human motion model for robust pose estimation will be presented at ICCV 2021.

- **_Apr-2021_** Srinath received a [Google Research Scholar](https://research.google/outreach/research-scholar-program/recipients/) award to further the group's research on object-centric perception/synthesis for mixed reality.

- **_Mar-2021_** Our upcoming [ICRA paper](https://aadilmehdis.github.io/DRACO-Project-Page/) shows how to learn to densely reconstruct and canonicalize shapes with only weak supervision. Please see the [project page](https://aadilmehdis.github.io/DRACO-Project-Page/) for details, code, and data.

- **_Nov-2020_** Our upcoming [NeurIPS spotlight](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2020/Schedule?type=Spotlight) paper shows how to learn 3D canonical spatiotemporal representations of dynamically moving point clouds. Please see the [project page](https://geometry.stanford.edu/projects/caspr/) for details.

- **_Aug-2020_** We organized the 3DReps Workshop at ECCV 2020. You can watch the recorded sessions on YouTube (Link: [Session 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaaiwCqEWI4), [Session 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BskUrVASLB4)).

- **_Aug-2020_** Upcoming paper at ECCV on [sparse multiview 3D surface recontruction](https://geometry.stanford.edu/projects/pix2surf/) aka Pix2Surf.

- **_Jan-2020_** I am serving on the program committee (Area Chair) for [IEEE VR 2020](http://ieeevr.org/2020/).

- **_Jan-2020_** Paper on [predicting object dynamics](https://geometry.stanford.edu/projects/learningdynamicsWACV2020/) of previously unseen objects accepted to WACV.

- **_Dec-2019_** [Davis Rempe](https://davrempe.github.io/) is presenting our paper on [multi-view aggregation for 3D reconstruction](https://geometry.stanford.edu/projects/xnocs/) at NeurIPS. Code and datasets are available.

- **_Jun-2019_** Watch the [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vz2yDmrVURQ) we did for our CVPR 2019 paper.

- **_May-2019_** Our [paper](https://storage.googleapis.com/pirk.io/projects/learning_interactions/index.html) on learning to generate human-object interactions was awarded an [honorable mention](https://cs.brown.edu/people/ssrinath/misc/photos/EG2019_HonMention_crop.jpg) at Eurographics 2019. Read my blog post on this work on the [SAIL Blog](http://ai.stanford.edu/blog/generate-human-object/).

- **_Mar-2019_** Can we estimate the 6D pose and size of novel object instances never encountered before? Our upcoming [CVPR oral paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02970) shows one way ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsfoLcInlhM)).
